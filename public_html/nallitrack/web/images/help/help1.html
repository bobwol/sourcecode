					<li>Coaches and team managers input their team rosters, and from our dashboard, plan out meets by matching athletes to events. Plans can be made public, or remain private.</li>
					<li>NalliTrack can be integrated into your web site. Parents and athletes don’t have to go to NalliTrack to say informed. We can stay behind the scenes if you want us to. We make it easy for you to embed NalliTrack reports in your existing site.</li>
